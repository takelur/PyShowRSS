# PyShowRSS

## Usage

Clone repository and add RSS feeds to `config/feeds.txt`. Made to work with https://showrss.info/. Then add your discord webhook URL(s) to `config/webhooks.txt`. They are separated by newline so add them on separate lines.

Then start the app with:
```bash
docker compose up -d
 ```
